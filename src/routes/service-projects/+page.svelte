	<h1 class="sub-title">Hands of Hope</h1>
	<p>
		Hands of Hope, based in Edison, NJ, is a compassionate and impactful non-profit community
		organization dedicated to alleviating hunger and promoting human dignity. With a steadfast
		commitment to providing essential sustenance, the organization operates as an efficient and
		centralized system for distributing food to those in need. Founded in 1992, Hands of Hope
		initially began as a food pantry/soup kitchen and has evolved into a beacon of support within
		the community. Driven by an unwavering mission, Hands of Hope aims to ensure good nutrition,
		health, and overall well-being, allowing individuals to realize their full potential and escape
		the challenges hunger presents.
	</p>
	<p>
		The J.P. Stevens Interact Club proudly partners with Hands of Hope in their noble endeavor.
		Biweekly, on the 1st and 3rd Saturday of every month, our dedicated club members volunteer their
		time and efforts to contribute meaningfully to this vital cause. In collaboration with Hands of
		Hope, our Interact Club engages in various activities such as pantry stocking to maintain
		inventory, efficiently delivering food to cars through a drive-up model established during the
		COVID-19 pandemic, and providing crucial sustenance to individuals and families in need. Through
		these collective efforts, we aim to make a tangible and positive impact within our community,
		one act of service at a time.

	<h1 class="sub-title">Operation Christmas Child</h1>
	<p>
		Operation Christmas Child, an initiative by the international Christian relief organization
		Samaritan's Purse, brings joy and hope to children in disadvantaged areas across the globe.
		Through this heartwarming project, individuals and groups come together to create gift-filled
		shoeboxes, filled with toys, school supplies, hygiene products, and personal notes, with the aim
		of brightening the lives of children facing challenging circumstances during the holiday season.
	</p>
	<p>
		At the J.P. Stevens Interact Club, our members wholeheartedly participate in this endeavor,
		demonstrating our commitment to making a meaningful impact. Each month, our dedicated members
		donate specific items that align with the designated theme of that month, contributing to the
		contents of these shoebox presents. Throughout the year, our collective effort results in a
		diverse assortment of thoughtful items. In June, the culmination of our year-long dedication
		sees us assembling these carefully curated items into shoebox gifts, creating personalized,
		heartfelt presents. These packages are then sent to children in need around the world, spreading
		not only the joy of receiving but also the powerful message of compassion, kindness, and the
		spirit of giving.

	<h1 class="sub-title">DTGB E-Club</h1>
	<p>
		The Dare to be Great E-Club is a vibrant community of change-makers with a global vision, driven
		by the profound belief in empowering young individuals to create audacious solutions for
		pressing world issues. Collaborating under the leadership of Mr. Bill Graham, the President of
		District 7475, the club facilitates a platform where the J.P. Stevens Interact Club actively
		participates in transformative initiatives. Notably, the annual Dare to be Great Competition
		challenges teams to conceive remarkably innovative solutions to major global problems. These
		proposals encompass intricate details, addressing how the solutions would function, their
		impact, implementation strategies, required resources, and organizational frameworks.
	</p>
	<p>
		Highlighting the remarkable impact of this collaboration, the J.P. Stevens Interact Club has
		consistently excelled in the Dare to be Great Competition. In 2019, three members from the club
		emerged victorious, earning the honor of presenting their project at the United Nations Summit
		in Mexico. In 2020, the club's exceptional prowess continued as two teams came first and second
		with their visionary proposals "Race Against E-Waste" and "Scrap to Tap" respectively.
		Facilitating these endeavors, regular meetings every other Saturday, conducted via Zoom and
		hosted by Mr. Graham, provides a dedicated space for mentorship, brainstorming, and fostering a
		culture of audacious problem-solving, contributing to the cultivation of future leaders and
		innovative thinkers.

	<h1 class="sub-title">Pen Pals</h1>
	<p>
		The J.P. Stevens Interact Club proudly spearheads an annual Pen Pal Program that extends a
		heartwarming connection between its dedicated members and senior citizens. This cherished
		initiative pairs club members with senior pen pals, fostering meaningful relationships through
		the simple yet powerful act of correspondence. Week after week, our club members engage in
		heartfelt exchanges with their pen pals, discussing a wide array of topics that range from
		personal likes and dislikes, treasured memories, vacation stories, favorite school subjects,
		unique talents, and ambitious goals. The communication flows both ways, encouraging members to
		also inquire about their pen pals' experiences and interests, thereby discovering shared
		passions and experiences.
	</p>
	<p>
		This invaluable Pen Pal Program has flourished over the past five years, leaving a trail of
		positive impacts and heartwarming connections in its wake. By bridging generational divides and
		offering a window into each other's worlds, this initiative not only enriches the lives of our
		club members but also brings joy, companionship, and a sense of purpose to the senior citizens
		involved. The Pen Pal Program stands as a testament to the enduring power of human connection
		and has become a cherished tradition that embodies the spirit of service, compassion, and
		community at the heart of the J.P. Stevens Interact Club.
